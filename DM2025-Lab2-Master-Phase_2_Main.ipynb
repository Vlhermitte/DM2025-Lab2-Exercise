    "The code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

      "*   **Patterns and Insights:** The goal is to identify recurring trends, correlations, anomalies, and relationships within the data. These patterns can reveal underlying structures, predict future behavior, or explain observed phenomena.\n",
      "*   **Knowledge Discovery:** The ultimate aim is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge that can be used for decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it Works (The Process):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining is usually an iterative process that involves several stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming stage. It involves:\n",
      "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Putting the discovered knowledge into practice. This could involve integrating it into business processes, creating reports, or building predictive models.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Data Mining Techniques:**\n",

      "Data mining employs a variety of techniques, often drawing from statistics, machine learning, and database systems. Some of the most common include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",
      "*   **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns that occur in a sequence over time (e.g., identifying common user navigation paths on a website).\n",

      "\n",
      "Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on **enabling computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.** Instead of providing a computer with a rigid set of instructions for every possible scenario, machine learning algorithms allow the computer to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve its performance over time as it encounters more data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like teaching a child. You don't give them a manual for every single object they'll encounter. Instead, you show them examples, explain what they are, and over time, they learn to recognize new objects and categorize them. Machine learning works on a similar principle, but with vast amounts of data and sophisticated algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Core Idea: Learning from Experience\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental concept behind machine learning is **learning from experience**, where \"experience\" is represented by data. Algorithms are trained on datasets, and through this training process, they develop models that can:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Identify patterns:** Discover underlying relationships and trends within the data.\n",
      "*   **Make predictions:** Forecast future outcomes or classify new data points based on learned patterns.\n",
      "*   **Make decisions:** Take actions or provide recommendations based on the insights gained from the data.\n",
      "*   **Improve over time:** As more data is fed into the system, the model can refine its understanding and become more accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How Does it Work? (Simplified)\n",
      "\n",
      "While the technical details can be complex, the general process involves:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant data for the task at hand. This could be anything from images and text to numerical measurements and user behavior.\n",
      "2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and organizing the data to make it suitable for the learning algorithm. This often involves handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical data.\n",
      "3.  **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem type (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).\n",
      "4.  **Training:** Feeding the preprocessed data to the chosen algorithm. The algorithm adjusts its internal parameters to minimize errors and learn the underlying patterns. This is where the \"learning\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Testing the trained model on a separate set of data (not used during training) to assess its performance and accuracy.\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Once the model is deemed satisfactory, it can be deployed to make predictions or perform tasks in real-world applications.\n",
      "7.  **Monitoring and Retraining:** Continuously monitoring the model's performance and retraining it with new data as needed to maintain its effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of Machine Learning:\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning algorithms are broadly categorized into three main types:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Supervised Learning:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each data point has a corresponding \"correct answer\" or output. The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels.\n",

      "        *   **Classification:** Predicting a categorical label (e.g., spam or not spam, disease or no disease, image of a cat or a dog).\n",
      "        *   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., house prices, stock prices, temperature).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Unsupervised Learning:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** The algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset. The goal is to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without any prior knowledge of the output.\n",
      "    *   **Examples:**\n",
      "        *   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation, anomaly detection).\n",
      "        *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information (e.g., for visualization or to improve model efficiency).\n",
      "        *   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\").\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reinforcement Learning:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. It receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize its cumulative reward over time. It's like learning through trial and error.\n",

      "## How Machine Learning Works (The Core Idea)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data Input:** ML models are fed large datasets (e.g., images, text, numbers, sensor readings). This is the \"experience\" the machine learns from.\n",
      "2.  **Pattern Recognition:** Algorithms analyze this data to find hidden patterns, correlations, and structures that might be too complex or subtle for humans to detect.\n",
      "3.  **Model Training:** Based on these patterns, the algorithm builds a \"model.\" This model is essentially a mathematical representation of the learned relationships within the data.\n",
      "4.  **Prediction/Decision:** Once trained, the model can then be given new, unseen data. It uses its learned knowledge (the model) to make predictions, classify information, or recommend actions.\n",
      "5.  **Feedback & Improvement:** The model's performance is evaluated. If its predictions are inaccurate, the model can be refined and retrained with more data or adjusted parameters, leading to continuous improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Distinction from Traditional Programming:**\n",
      "*   **Traditional Programming:** You write explicit rules for the computer to follow (e.g., `IF temperature > 30 THEN turn_on_AC`).\n",
      "*   **Machine Learning:** You provide data, and the computer *learns* the rules itself (e.g., by analyzing historical temperature and AC usage data, it learns when to turn on the AC).\n",

      "2.  **Unsupervised Learning:**\n",
      "    *   **Concept:** The model learns from \"unlabeled\" data, trying to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on its own, without any predefined output. It's like learning without a teacher, just exploring.\n",

      "face, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \n",
      "example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n",
      "diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n",
      "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",
      "discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n",
      "themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n",
      "This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n",
      "during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n",
      "uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n",

      "black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n",
      "planets. \n",
      "Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n",
      "opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n",
      "‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n",
      "feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n",
      "that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n",
      "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",
      "seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n",
      "At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n",
      "tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n",
      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",
      "wonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \n",
      "them to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \n",
      "bamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \n",
      "watch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \n",
      "will one day come true. \n",
      "Overall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",

    "# 1. Zero-shot Classification:\n",
    "#    - Accuracy: The accuracy of the zero-shot classification was the lowest among the three methods. This is\n",
    "#    expected as the model had no prior examples to guide its predictions.\n",
    "#    - Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix showed a significant number of misclassifications across multiple\n",

    "#    context.\n",
    "# 2. 1-shot Classification:\n",
    "#    - Accuracy: The accuracy improved compared to the zero-shot approach. The model benefited from having\n",
    "#    one example per emotion, which provided some context for classification.\n",
    "#    - Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix showed fewer misclassifications, particularly in categories\n",
    "#    that were previously confused in the zero-shot scenario. However, some emotions still had notable\n",
    "#    confusion.\n",
    "# 3. 5-shot Classification:\n",
    "#    - Accuracy: The 5-shot classification yielded the highest accuracy. The model had multiple examples\n",
    "#    per emotion, which significantly enhanced its understanding and ability to classify correctly.\n",
    "#    - Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix revealed a marked reduction in misclassifications across\n",

    "#    the additional context provided by the examples.\n",
    "#    However, there were still a few instances of confusion.\n",
    "# Overall, the results demonstrate that providing more examples in the prompt leads to better classification performance. The model's ability to learn from context improves with the number of examples, resulting in higher accuracy and reduced confusion between emotion categories."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
